Mphys workshop: Aerostructural workshop problem discussion

- Proposal for future cases/problems that might be considered in future years
- Goal is to coalesce around cases; get more cases out in the open
- Gets people to put more information about what they are working on

Justin: goal is broader participation; 3 classes of problem: easy medium and hard; easy year 1, medium year 2, hard year 3, etc.\
  - Year 3 could be bring your own problem, or you could have a BYOP option each year

Anil: show/compare gradient accuracy, optimimality of metrics, etc.

Jamie Akkala: need wing and fuselage combined
  - ESAVE model?
  - Need accurate trim calculations, control surface modeling (future)

Tim: Reach out to industry to see what needs this could fill; get industry active as reviewers

Jamie: run optimization in a way that minimizes sensitivity of flutter wrt mass changes so that conceptual design is more usable as the design matures
  - Pose objective metrics in a way to work with manufacturing better

Justin: need more feedback from industry about why academic problems aren’t useful for them (more load cases, etc.)

Brett: maybe year 1 should be more of a special session than a workshop; invited talks, suggest ideas
  - AEPW: has required cases and then optional more challenging cases

Kevin: after proposals come in year 1, down select next years so that you have more overlap in results to compare, validate, etc. (don’t move forward with all ideas)
  - Make agreed upon problem statement
  - Use RFP approach to describe future cases that people want to work on

Jamie: split up aero optimization and structural optimization in year 1

Tim: open this up to other coupled optimization, aeroacoustic, Aeropropulsive, etc.; maybe stick with aerostructural first year

Justin: good test problem is a sail plane
  - Focus needs to be on MDO + high-fidelity optimization
  - Steady vs. unsteady: focus on steady for first workshop

Agreement on: optimization tolerances, problem definitions, gradient accuracy, other standards
  - POEM process - pull request to submit proposals
  - Put these notes on GitHub

Maintain interest: make everyone solve the same problem (table stakes) 
  - you have to tackle that problem to come in, and then you can come and talk about whatever you want; layout 3ish-year list; cycle disciplines every year

  - Trim, wing-body configurations are two areas that could be tackled early on
  - Make them low-speed enough to make these simple enough for people to solve somewhat easily

Counterpoint: if we change disciplines every year, it doesn’t give people time to apply lessons learned, so keep some common aspect every year

Accumulate cases: every year, add an aspect, discipline, etc.

Next steps, timeline:
Targeting SciTech 2024, maybe Aviation 2024
By Dec need to have a concrete plan
